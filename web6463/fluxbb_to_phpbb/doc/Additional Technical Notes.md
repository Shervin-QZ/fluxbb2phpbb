Additional Technical Notes

    Admin Account Credentials: Ensure the phpBB administrator account uses the same username and email as the FluxBB administrator account. 
    The password may differ if necessary, but matching username and email helps maintain consistent user identification between the two systems.

    Database Table Prefixes: Configure the migration so that FluxBB and phpBB tables coexist in the same database using distinct table prefixes (e.g., flux_ for FluxBB tables and phpbb_ for phpBB tables). 
    This separation prevents table name conflicts and allows both forums to share the database during the migration.

    Clearing the phpBB Cache: After the migration script has finished running, clear the phpBB cache to ensure all migrated content is recognized. 
    You can clear the cache through the phpBB Administration Control Panel or by manually deleting the cache files. This step is crucial to refresh phpBBâ€™s cached data and display the newly imported forum content correctly.

    phpBB Extension Directory Structure: Each phpBB extension must be placed in two nested folders under the ext/ directory. 
    The top-level folder should be the extension vendor or author name, and the subfolder should be the extension name (for example, ext/vendorname/extensionname/). Following this directory structure ensures phpBB can locate and load the extension correctly.
